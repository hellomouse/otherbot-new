NOTE: this is currently a random collection of ideas that may or may not be
relevant. as such, don't actually expect any of this to even make sense

api:
    ability to disable/enable capabilities
    irc modes parser and composer
    modularity:
        make it easy to add support for more things in the core
    Channel object
        Channel#setMode, Channel#kick, etc
        list of users
    User object
        channels they are in
        is this user currently tracked? (does the client receive QUIT/NICK/etc about them?)
            untracked users cannot be reliably messaged
    ChannelRegistry object
        stores channels
        get channel by name
    UserRegistry object
        stores users and the channels they are in
    ServerInfo object
        stores server ISUPPORT info, caps, etc
    PendingCommand object
        it may have succeeded, it may have failed
        array in client of PendingCommand objects that are still pending

general protocol:
    use the streaming parser
    be able to tell which commands errored and report back errors
    command sent callbacks (out of queue)
    be able to handle commands that return data
    be able to handle commands which have multiple lines of results (WHO, WHOIS, etc)
    a humongous list of acknowledgeable commands that are yet to be acknowledged or errored
        properly return errors to whatever caused them
            see PendingCommand object

send queues:
    queue delay to set time between queue output
    acutally reliable queue bursting
    each queue has many priorities

    main server queue:
        level 0: really important stuff (PING, CAP, login, etc)
        level 1: server stuff (nick changes, join, part, etc)
        level 2: channel stuff (KICK, MODE, etc)
        level 3: channel messages (per-channel queues feed into this)
        level 4: channel/user tracking (WHO, WHOIS, cmode tracking, etc
    per-channel message queues:
        supports multiple priorities (default 3)
        queue delay/bursting is handled independently of main queue
        per-channel message queue delay is 1000ms, main queue delay is 500ms
        main queue will fetch stuff from each channel queue
        fairness: a channel with a lot of queued messages will not interrupt other channels

channel tracking:
    tracks users, channel mode lists (ban lists, etc), will determine chanop-only lists
    use WHOX if available
        record last WHO sent
